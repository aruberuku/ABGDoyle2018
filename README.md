# ABGDoyle2018

Evaluation of code upon which Ahneman 2018 was based, with application of additional analyses using XGBoost and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP).
SHAP was found to allow for analyses suggestive of statistical effects (associations) between various computationally-derived descriptor datas and experimentally observed chemical yield. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the effect estimates generated by SHAP can be used for further, teritiary analyses, in a way similar to the use of scaled data in multivariate analyses. However, several major advantages of SHAP wrt interpretability are shown.
